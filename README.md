# Advent of Code 2024

Wherein I attempt to learn rust but don't really put enough effort into it.

Actually I will just flex c++20 ranges and lament that I don't know how to do
the same in the language I have spent like 3 hours trying to learn.

## Tested with

C++:
- cmake 3.28.3
- gcc 14.2.1
- fedora:41

Rust:
- rust stuff
